<!--
  IMPORTANT: PRs without a linked issue will be CLOSED automatically.
  This project follows a strict issue-first workflow:

  1. Open an issue describing the bug or feature
  2. Wait for a maintainer to add `status:approved`
  3. THEN open this PR linking that issue

  Skipping any of these steps = PR closed without review.
-->
